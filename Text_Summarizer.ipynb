            " Blackpink (Hangul: Blackpink; commonly stylized as BLACKPINK or Blackpink) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa.  The group debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which featured \"Whistle\" and \"Boombayah\", their first number-one hits on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart, respectively.  Blackpink is the highest-charting female Korean act on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 13 with their 2020 single \"Ice Cream\", and on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 24 with Kill This Love (2019).  They were the first Korean girl group to enter and top Billboard's Emerging Artists chart and to top the Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart three times.  Blackpink is also the first female Korean act to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with their hit single \"Ddu-Du Ddu-Du\" (2018), which currently has the most-viewed music video by a Korean group on YouTube.  They have the most top 40 hits in the United Kingdom among all Korean artists.  Their 2018 single \"Kiss and Make Up\" was the first-ever song by a Korean group to receive a certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and to be certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).  Furthermore, their 2020 single \"How You Like That\" was the first-ever song by a Korean act to receive a certification from Pro-Música Brasil.  Blackpink has broken numerous online records throughout their career; the music videos for \"Kill This Love\" (2019) and \"How You Like That\" each set records for the most-viewed music video within the first 24 hours of release, with the latter breaking three and setting two Guinness World Records.  They are also the first Korean group to have two music videos with at least one billion views on YouTube.  \"How You Like That\" also became the fastest Korean single to reach double platinum on QQ Music, China's biggest music streaming platform.  Blackpink's other accolades include the New Artist of the Year Awards at the 31st Golden Disc Awards and the 26th Seoul Music Awards, as well as recognition as the most powerful celebrities in South Korea by Forbes Korea in 2019, and as the first female Korean group on Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia.  They were also the first K-pop girl group to win an MTV Music Video Award.  They are currently the most-followed girl group on Spotify and the most-subscribed music group, female act, and Asian act on YouTube.  Blackpink began forming when YG Entertainment held tryouts worldwide for preteen or teenage recruits to create a new girl group after launching its first girl group, 2NE1, in 2009.  According to the members, joining the label as trainees was similar to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with Jennie calling it \"more strict than school\" and Rosé comparing it to The X Factor with dorm rooms.  For members who had left behind life outside of South Korea, the pace of training alongside the culture shock was tough.  Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as 2011 when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14, 2011 that the label's new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 featuring at least seven members.  From then, there were numerous news and rumors surrounding the new girl group about their debut being delayed but there was no official information.  It was only until May 18, 2016 that YG Entertainment confirmed the new girl group, stating that the members were selected through years of stiff competition and confirming that the debut would be in July.  The label later confirmed that Jang Hanna and Moon Sua, who were introduced to the public as potential members of the new girl group, were not included in the debut lineup.  Jennie was the first member revealed to be in the group on June 1.  Jennie joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in 2010 after moving back to South Korea from New Zealand.  In 2012, she was introduced to the public for the first time through a photo titled \"Who's that girl?\" via the official blog of YG Entertainment on April 10.  Jennie continued to be promoted as a member of the new girl group with multiple collaborations, such as starring in G-Dragon's 2012 music video \"That XX\" from One of a Kind EP and featuring in G-Dragon's \"Black\" from 2013 album Coup d'etat, and Lee Hi's \"Special\" from 2013 album First Love.  Lisa was revealed to be the second member on June 8, 2016.  Lisa was the only individual among 4,000 applicants to pass the 2010 YG Entertainment audition in her native Thailand, becoming the first foreign trainee to join the label in 2011.  She was first introduced in 2012 with a video that was posted on YG Entertainment's official YouTube channel titled \"Who's That Girl???\".  Lisa also appeared in the music video for Taeyang's \"Ringa Linga\" in 2013.  She then took on her first modelling job in 2015 for street-wear brand Nona9on, following by modelling for cosmetics brand Moonshot in 2016.  On June 15, Jisoo was revealed to be the third member.  Jisoo joined YG Entertainment as an trainee in July 2011.  She appeared in several advertisements and music videos in her pre-debut years, including \"Spoiler + Happy Ending\" (2014) from Epik High's studio album Shoebox and Hi Suhyun's music video \"I'm Different\" (2014).  She also made a cameo appearance in 2015 drama The Producers.  Rosé was revealed to be a member on June 22, 2016.  She ranked first among 700 applicants in the 2012 YG Entertainment audition in Australia, resulting in a trainee contract with the label and a move to Seoul to begin her training.  She was featured in G-Dragon's track \"Without You\" from One of a Kind EP in 2012 as \"? from YG New Girl Group\".  However, her featuring vocals and identity was kept secret for almost four years until the her official public introduction when it was revealed that she participated in the song.  On June 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that the new girl group includes four members instead of the original plan of having nine members, and revealed Blackpink as the group's official name.  According to a representative, Blackpink meant \"pretty isn't everything\" and symbolized that \"they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, but also great talent. \" Jisoo later disclosed in a press conference that they almost debuted as 'Pink Punk', 'Baby Monster' or 'Magnum'.  Blackpink released their first dance practice video on July 6 to great attention from viewers.  On July 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that Blackpink's debut would be on August 8, 2016.  Promotions for their debut began in the first week of August 2016 with the release of teaser images, videos, and advertisements.  The first girl group to debut under YG Entertainment in seven years, Blackpink released their debut single album, Square One, on August 8, 2016, consisting of tracks \"Boombayah\" and \"Whistle\".  They charted at number one and two on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart, which made Blackpink the fastest act to achieve such feat and the third Korean artist to hold the top two positions simultaneously, after label mates Psy and Big Bang.  \"Whistle\" quickly topped the digital, download, streaming, and mobile charts on Gaon.  The group also reached number one on the weekly, popularity, music video, and K-pop music video charts of China's biggest music-streaming service, QQ Music.  Blackpink's first music show performance was aired on August 14, 2016, on SBS's Inkigayo.  They won first place on Inkigayo 13 days after their debut, breaking the record for the shortest time for a girl group to win on a music program after debut.  They wrapped up their promotions for Square One on September 11, 2016, with another win on Inkigayo.  Blackpink released their second single album, Square Two, consisting of tracks \"Playing with Fire\" and \"Stay\", on November 1, 2016.  The group began their promotions on Inkigayo on November 6 and on Mnet's M Countdown on November 10.  \"Playing with Fire\" was Blackpink's second single to reach number one on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart and first K-pop girl group song to chart on the Canadian Hot 100.  In South Korea, \"Playing with Fire\" peaked at number three while \"Stay\" placed in the top ten.  Blackpink's commercial success in their first five months earned them several rookie awards at major Korean year-end music award shows, including the Asia Artist Awards, Melon Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, Seoul Music Awards, and Gaon Chart Music Awards.  Additionally, Billboard named them one of the best new K-pop groups of 2016.  On January 17, 2017, Blackpink revealed the name of their fan club—\"Blink\", a portmanteau of \"black\" and \"pink. \" On June 22, the group released their first standalone digital single, \"As If It's Your Last\".  It was described as a \"mixed genre of music\" and a change of sound from their previous releases.  The song debuted at number one on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart one day after release, making it their third number-one hit on the chart.  The music video for the song later went on to break the record for the most-liked music video by a Korean girl group on YouTube as well as the most-viewed K-pop group music video in the first 24 hours of release.  On July 20, 2017, Blackpink held a showcase at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, which was attended by more than 14,000 people, with as many as 200,000 people attempting to purchase tickets.  The group made their Japanese debut on August 30, 2017, with the release of a self-titled Japanese extended play that included Japanese versions of their previous singles.  The EP debuted and peaked at the top of the Oricon Albums Chart.  Blackpink ranked among YouTube's Global Top 25 Songs of the Summer for 2017 with \"As If It's Your Last\".  On January 6, 2018, Blackpink released the first episode of their first reality show Blackpink House, which were comprised of 12 episodes releasing throughout 2018 following the four members spending 100 days of vacation as they moved into their new dorm, via their official V Live and Youtube channels.  On March 28, Blackpink re-released their debut Japanese EP under the name Re:Blackpink.  The digital version included the same songs as the original release, while the physical version included a DVD containing all music videos and six songs in the Korean language.  On June 15, 2018, the group released their first Korean-language EP, titled Square Up.  The lead single, \"Ddu-Du Ddu-Du\", debuted at number 17 on the Official Trending Chart in the United Kingdom, making them the first female K-pop group to enter the chart since its launch in 2016.  The single also debuted at number 55 on the Billboard Hot 100, with 12. 4 million U. S.  streams and 7,000 downloads in the tracking week ending June 21, 2018, making Blackpink the highest-charting Korean girl group on the chart.  The single also debuted at number 39 on the U. S.  Streaming Songs chart, making Blackpink became the first K-pop girl group to enter the chart.  Square Up also brought the group their first entry and the highest-charting album by an all-female K-pop group at the time of its release on the Billboard 200, debuting at number 40 with 14,000 equivalent units.  The EP also topped the Billboard World Albums chart.  In South Korea, Square Up debuted at number one on Gaon Albums Chart.  \"Ddu-Du Ddu-Du\" peaked at number one on the digital, download, streaming, and mobile charts on Gaon in its second week, while \"Forever Young\" peaked at number two.  YouTube's official tally saw the music video for \"Ddu-Du Ddu-Du\" garner a total of 36. 2 million views within 24 hours after its release, making it the most-viewed online video in the first 24 hours by a Korean act and the second most-watched music video of all time in first 24 hours of release at that time.  Blackpink embarked on their sold-out first Japan tour, Blackpink Arena Tour 2018, in Osaka from July 24 to 25 to promote their Japanese EP.  The tour was initially composed of 6 shows throughout Osaka, Fukuoka and Chiba, but an additional show in Chiba was added due to overwhelming demand.  The final stop of the tour was later added for December 24 at Kyocera Dome Osaka as a Christmas gift for fans, which they later performed to a sold-out crowd of 50,000.  On September 12, it was announced that the group would hold their first concert in Seoul titled \"Blackpink 2018 Tour  Seoul x BC Card\" at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena.  The concert led to the In Your Area World Tour, which continued throughout 2019 and early 2020 in North America, Europe, Oceania and Asia.  The tour ultimately became the highest-grossing tour by a Korean girl group by the end of its run.  On October 19, English singer Dua Lipa released \"Kiss and Make Up\" with Blackpink, a new track for the re-released edition of her self-titled debut album.  \"Kiss and Make Up\" debuted at number 93 at the Billboard Hot 100, marking Blackpink's second entry in the chart and making them the only Korean girl group to score at least two entries on the chart.  The song also became their second entry in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 36, and their first top 40 entry.  They were the first female Korean group and third Korean act overall to reach the top 40.  In October 2018, the group signed with Interscope Records in a global partnership with YG Entertainment; they were to be represented by Interscope and Universal Music Group outside of Asia.  In November 2018, Blackpink announced additional tour dates for their \"In Your Area World Tour\", which covered thirteen dates across Asia from January to March 2019.
